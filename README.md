# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI

In this project, I developed a complete financial dashboard using Power BI to analyze credit card transaction data. My objective was to create a tool that provides weekly insights into customer spending habits and transaction trends, enabling smarter business decisions.

## Project Workflow: 

I managed the entire project lifecycle, from initial data extraction to the final dashboard presentation. This involved:

Data Integration: I successfully connected Power BI to an SQL database, importing and modeling the data for analysis.

Advanced DAX Calculations: I wrote complex DAX queries to create new measures and columns, such as "Age Group," "Income Group," and "Week-over-Week Revenue Change." This allowed for deeper, more meaningful analysis.

Interactive Dashboard Design: I designed and built two user-friendly dashboardsâ€”a Transaction Report and a Customer Report. I used a variety of visualizations, including stacked charts, tables, and KPI cards, to present the data clearly.

Insight Generation: My analysis uncovered key trends, such as the top contributing customer demographics, most profitable card types, and weekly revenue fluctuations.

## Technologies I Used:

Power BI: Leveraged for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.

SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Used for robust data storage and retrieval.

DAX: Applied my knowledge of DAX functions like SWITCH, CALCULATE, FILTER, and DIVIDE to perform complex calculations.
